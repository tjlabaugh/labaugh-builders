					</p>
					<span id="formula" class="bold clear">

				<h3>Our Building Area</h3>
				<article>
					<p>
						As a custom building company, we feel most fortunate with our opportunity to market what we believe to be two of the most elegant areas on the East Coast. The Jersey Shore encompasses the beautiful communities of Bay Head, Mantoloking, Brielle, Sea Girt and Spring Lake. Also in South Carolina we have had the pleasure to design / build gorgeous 'Low Country' style homes in Pawleys Island.
					</p>
					<p>
						We understand that the planning and monitoring of a home construction project can be very overwhelming. For these reasons, our projects are well organized and carefully crafted according to strict guidelines that will enable us to assist you and keep you informed every step of the way ~ allowing this experience to be an enjoyable one. From the First Initial Meeting ~ all the way through the Design, Planning, Permit Process, Construction, Inspections and Final Clean-Up. Monthly Budgets will be provided along with Scheduled Reports that track the Progress of the Project. This method allows adequate time to decide those important decisions while also providing the assurance that the project is being completed in accordance with the contract.
